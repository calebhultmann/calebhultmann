## Hello there, I'm Caleb! 👋
Check out my [personal Instagram](https://instagram.com/calebhultmann), or my new [photography account](https://instagram.com/clebbography)!

## About me
I'm a computer science student studying at Harvard University with a deep interest in low-level systems, emulation, and operating systems development 🕹️. I spend most of my time writing in C++ and building personal projects. When I'm not in Visual Studio or updating GitHub, I can be found riding my motorcyle 🏍️, playing videogames 🎮, longboarding 🛹, improving my photography skills 📸, or training for the Cambridge half marathon 🏃‍♂️‍➡️.

## 🛠️ I recently built
A cycle-accurate emulator of the MOS6502 microprocessor in C++.
The project is still in development, but check out the current version [here](https://github.com/calebhultmann/MOS6502-Emulator)!

## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- Improving my 6502 emulator
- Writing an assembler and disassembler for 6502 Assembly
- Putting together a portfolio website

## 🌱 I’m currently learning how to
- Emulate retro game consoles (NES, GameBoy)
- Implement visual I/O in C++


## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- Systems projects
- Low-level development
- C++ based
