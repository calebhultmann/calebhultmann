## Hello there, I'm Caleb! 👋
I'm a Junior at Harvard University studying computer science with a deep interest in low-level systems, emulation, and operating systems development. Outside of classes and Visual Studio, you can find me riding my CBR500r🏍️, improving my photography skills📷, or training for my next half marathon🏃‍♂️.

## What do I do? 📖
I specialize in C++ and OCaml for development of low level systems. In uni, I'm currently building an Oat (simple-C) compiler in OCaml. In my free time, I'm emulating an original Nintendo GameBoy in C++.

## What have I worked on? 🛠️
My recent projects have included:
- A cycle-accurate emulator of the MOS6502 microprocessor in C++, which you can find [here](https://github.com/calebhultmann/MOS6502-Emulator)
- A rudimentary assembler for the 6502 which can also be found [here](https://github.com/calebhultmann/6502-Assembler)
- Implementing core Linux kernel features in C++. This repository is private due to restrictions on code publication at my university. If you are interested, reach out to me!
- Building an Oat (simple-C) language compiler in OCaml to produce optimized x86 assembly through an LLVM IR. This repository is also private for the reasons above
